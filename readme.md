The code performs the following:
- divide the parent div up into a grid of equally-sized cells so that each cell is as near 100x100px as can be
- randomly position any child divs in the parent div and size them to the grid sizes set by their gridwide and gridtall properties
- walk the rest of the grid and determine which borders it has, and therefore what type of cell it is
- populate each cell with the appropriate knotwork image for that cell type

There are two knotwork image sets and two 'template' sets included, and a button to switch between them.
